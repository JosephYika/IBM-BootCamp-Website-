# IBM-BootCamp-Website
A website created during the IBM Boot camp. The Bootcamp focused on Web Development ( HTML and CSS). 
I mainly used this BootCamp to refresh my knowledge about HTML and CSS and complement one of my modules at the university, where I had to create a website using ASP.NET Core, MVC, C#, JavaScript and of course HTML and CSS.

## Why IBM BootCamp? 

To refresh my knowledge about HTML, CSS, Git and GitHub.

# Session 1 (Git and Github)

! GIT: 
A Version Control System 

! GitHub: 
A website that allows us to store our git repositories (our projects with our code).
