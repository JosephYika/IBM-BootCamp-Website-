# IBM-BootCamp-Website
A website created during the IBM Boot camp. The Bootcamp focused on Web Development ( HTML and CSS). 
I mainly used this BootCamp to refresh my knowledge about HTML and CSS and complement one of my modules at the university, where I had to create a website using ASP.NET Core, MVC, C#, JavaScript and of course HTML and CSS.

## Why IBM BootCamp? 

To refresh my knowledge about HTML, CSS, Git and GitHub.

# Session 1 (Git and Github): What Have I learned so far? 

**I will be adding more things as I continue learning.** 

! **GIT**: 
A Version Control System: Git is a version control system that allows us to track and save our changes. We can also push our changes to GitHub or pull them to our computer. 

! **GitHub**: 
A website that allows us to store our git repositories (our projects with our code). This is where all of our repositories are stored. 

**Git Commands:** 
When we want to start using git commands in the terminal we firstly have to type **git**, which is then followed by any of the commands listed below (commands are Gtyped in lower case letters):

An example of sequence of commands that we would use when creating our project locally on the computer (i.e. in the IDE such as VS code ):

**init** - initializes a git repository (created by us)\
**add** - tracks files and changes to Git\
**commit** - save changes made to the code (or text if it is a README.mf file for example)\
**push** - upload Git files to a remote repository , like GitHub\
**pull** - download changes made to the code on GitHub. "Pull" down the changes.

Other useful commands

**clone** - clone the repository from GitHub\
**status** - shows us the status of our files\
**remote** - used when creating a connection between a new file that was created locally on the computer and GitHub. 
**checkout** - lets us navigate between the branches 

**SSH Keys**\
If we want to push our files to GitHub we need to prove to GitHub that we are owner of our account, meaning we have to connect our local computer to the GitHub account. This is done using SSH Keys. 

1. First we have to generate a key 
2. Then we have to paste this key in GitHub under: **Settings** - > **SSH Keys and GPG Keys**
