# IBM-BootCamp-Website
A website created during the IBM Boot camp. The Bootcamp focused on Web Development ( HTML and CSS). 
I mainly used this BootCamp to refresh my knowledge about HTML and CSS and complement one of my modules at the university, where I had to create a website using ASP.NET Core, MVC, C#, JavaScript and of course HTML and CSS.

## Why IBM BootCamp? 

To refresh my knowledge about HTML, CSS, Git and GitHub.
